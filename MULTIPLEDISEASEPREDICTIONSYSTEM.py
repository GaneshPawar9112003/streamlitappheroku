        **Type 1 Diabetes**: The body's immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.
        **Type 2 Diabetes**: The body becomes resistant to insulin or the pancreas does not produce enough insulin.

        Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement. It occurs when nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter that helps control movement, become damaged or die. 

        **Symptoms**: 
        - Tremors or shaking
        - Stiffness or rigidity
        - Slowness of movement
        - Balance and coordination problems

        Parkinson's disease is progressive, meaning that symptoms worsen over time. While there is no cure, treatments are available to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.
